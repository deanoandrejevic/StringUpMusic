                            This is huge! We have the lead guitarist of Avenged Sevenfold coming in to our shop to talk
                            about the bands music and his musical experiences. He will also be playing some of his
                            favourite riffs and solos for all of you. If that wasn't good enough there will also be a
                            Q&A session. So if you have any burning questions you want to ask then you'll get that
                            chance.

                            Our partners at Fender are coming down to hold a special workshop with you lot! They will be
                            showing the latest models of Stratocasters and Telecasters. There will be hands on time with
                            the guitars and there will also be the oppotunity to buy the new models at a discount price
                            just for attending the event.

                            We are so excited to welcome Spiritbox! They are still hard at work writing their new album
                            but we managed to snatch them away for a few short days to play here at String Up. We have
                            also convinced them to play a couple of new songs for the VERY FIRST TIME! They will also be
                            playing
                            bangers like Holy Roller and Blessed Be. You don't want to miss this!

                            After riding high on the success of Erratic Cinematic, Gerry is about to start writing his
                            new album, but before he does, he wanted to come in and play one last gig for you! So if you
                            want to hear songs like Belter and Sometimes then make sure you snag tickets for this. Oh
                            and as always there will be a short Q&A after the gig!
