# Scope

-  This website adopts a minimal style. Sometimes known as Minimal Viable Product. This has many advantages such as.

1. good for early adopters to the site
2. conveys enough information on the site to effectivly get the message across
3. Also it helps myself, as I am fairly new to this it fits my knowledge and my skill level well

This site is about the music, and I really want to be able to get that across. The home screen hits you straight away with a picture of a 
concert. The logo is consistent across the whole site which also has it's musical touch. Music is a very personal for a lot of people and 
by hitting them fast with images of concerts helps invites the customer in to the site and explore around. It will also encourage them to
hopefully get in touch with us and ask us anything they like.

# Structure

- The original plan was to go for a 4 page website, but I ultimatly decided to go with just a three page site. The reason being is purely based on my own
skill level. I didn't want to be to ambitious and then as a result the rest of the site suffer. The home page is designed to intice
you in straight away. It is also designed to encourage the user to scroll and explore straight away. The homepage will have a small section that will
concisely explain what String Up does. We will then move on to the events page. This is fairly self explaintary, this page will explain what the upcoming
events are. It will also say what date it is and also where to buy tickets to the events. It will layed out so it is easy to read and even easier on mobile.
The final page is the contact page. This page will invite you to contact String Up. It will also display job opportunities using the bootstrap 
grid system, which will make it accessible for everyone regardless of device. The footer will be displayed across all pages, it will just contain a small amount of
information about the company, social media platforms, partners of String Up and License information for the venue itself. The total goal of this is create an attractive
yet informative website.

# Wireframes

- My wireframes are basically exactly the same as my actually website. The biggest difference is on the events page. Where there was meant to be gradual reduction in the amount of events
per row. I couldn't quite achieve that. so it ended up being 3 events per row straight down to 1 per row.
